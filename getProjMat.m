function [ projMat ] = getProjMat( vec1, vec2 )
%getProjMat returns transformation (projection) matrix so that projMat * x
%is a projection of x onto vec1, vec2 plane. The assumption is that vec1 and
%vec2 are vector columns and are of the same size

% get basis
% g-s ortogonalization
% now tranform basis vectors and group them in column
%return
